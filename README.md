- 
-  What do they represent in the computer level, in terms of memory, processing, etc? Why are they different and how are they different from each other?

## [Basic Programming Concepts](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-are-the-basic-fundamental-concepts-of-programming)

-  What are the concepts and use cases of each one of them?
-  How do we know where and  how to apply each concept to particular languages?
-  What makes it possible to write code that receives the same input and produces the same output in different languages?
-  What causes one program to be more efficient than another? How does resource management comes into play here?

-  What are Data Structures and how do they relate to the data types?
-  Why do we need to represent data using data structures?
-  What are the strengths and weaknesses of each data structure? In which cases do one perform better than the others.

## [Data Structures & Algorithms Pt. 2](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/)

-  What is an algorithm?
-  How do algorithms relate to data structures?
-  How do algorithms relate to programming concepts?
